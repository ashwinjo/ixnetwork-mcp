### MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs. Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications. Just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect your devices to various peripherals and accessories, MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools.

​
### Why MCP?
* MCP helps you build agents and complex workflows on top of LLMs. 
* LLMs frequently need to integrate with data and tools, and MCP provides:
  > A growing list of pre-built integrations that your LLM can directly plug into
  > The flexibility to switch between LLM providers and vendors
  > Best practices for securing your data within your infrastructure
